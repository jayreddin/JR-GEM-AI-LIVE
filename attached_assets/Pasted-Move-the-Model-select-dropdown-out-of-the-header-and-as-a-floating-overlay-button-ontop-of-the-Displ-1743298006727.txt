Move the Model select dropdown out of the header and as a floating overlay button ontop of the Display box. make it oval.

in the header I want 2 new tabs: LIVE and IMG, LIVE is the current page from the header down,

when IMG is clicked a new tab appears and this tab is for generating and editing images with Gemini. Match the text input box in the IMG tab only in IMG the text command will be sent to gemini as context to generate an image. Keep the location on the ican bar and icons except they will be diffrent: 1st icon, stays + and operates the same. 2nd: Image, when pressed a pop up appears where the user can upload an image to edit,

heres some examples of the Image Gen api:

Image Edit, Birthday card maker, Story with images generator,

Image Generation:

const { GoogleGenAI } = require("@google/genai");
const fs = require("fs");
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });
async function generateImage() {
  const contents = "Hi, can you create a 3d rendered image of a pig " +
    "with wings and a top hat flying over a happy " +
    "futuristic scifi city with lots of greenery?";
  try {
    // Set responseModalities to include "Image" so the model can generate  an image
    const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
      model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation',
      contents: contents,
      config: {
        responseModalities: ['Text', 'Image']
      },
    });
    for (const part of response.candidates[0].content.parts) {
      // Based on the part type, either show the text or save the image
      if (part.text) {
        console.log(part.text);
      } else if (part.inlineData) {
        const imageData = part.inlineData.data;
        const buffer = Buffer.from(imageData, 'base64');
        fs.writeFileSync('gemini-native-image.png', buffer);
        console.log('Image saved as gemini-native-image.png');
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating content:", error);
  }
}
generateImage();
Have options for the user to select those diffrent Image Generating types, it will default and when first opened be on Image generation, Have the Display box same from the LIVE tab but in IMG generation its where the images are displayed
